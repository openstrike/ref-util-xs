# NAME

Ref::Util::XS - XS implementation for Ref::Util

# VERSION

version 0.117

# SYNOPSIS

    use Ref::Util;
    # Don't use Ref::Util::XS directly!

    if (is_arrayref($something) {
        print for @$something;
    }
    elsif (is_hashref($something)) {
        print for sort values %$something;
    }

# DESCRIPTION

Ref::Util::XS is the XS implementation of Ref::Util, which provides several
functions to help identify references in a more convenient way than the
usual approach of examining the return value of `ref`.

You should use [Ref::Util::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Ref::Util::XS) by installing [Ref::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/Ref::Util) itself: if the system
you install it on has a C compiler available, `Ref::Util::XS` will be
installed and used automatically, providing a significant speed boost to
everything that uses `Ref::Util`.

See [Ref::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/Ref::Util) for full documentation of the available functions.
